# 1 what's this project is to do:
	by obtaining large amount of data, find some clues toward valueable investiments. currently i am considering stock data and lottery data(lol),just for fun , but aiming at learning basic data processing technology.*

# 2 about lottery:
	i have built a simulator for basic statistic verify, for lottery, I think using probability model could reveal something(or not). this try would end as soon as when our model failed to predict 100 times*
